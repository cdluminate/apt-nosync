Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 12~),

Package: apt-nosync
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, apt, aptitude, eatmydata,
Description: Accelerate APT and DPKG with eatmydata
 This package will divert apt and dpkg executables and replace them with
 eatmydata-based wrapper scripts. This would result in significantly
 faster apt and dpkg actions, and some side effects.
